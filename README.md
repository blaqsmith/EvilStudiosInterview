Android apk is located in the InterviewTiles directory.

Xcode project is located in the InterviewTiles /iOS directory, and although I cannot speak for the quality of the project that is auto-generated by Unity, it should hopefully run fairly well.

Actual Unity code and assets can be found mostly in the InterviewTiles /Asset folder.

Audio is minimal, as I'd rather not subject you to deaf developer audio choices ;)
